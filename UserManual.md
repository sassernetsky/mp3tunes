## Installing ##

Most end-users should install the MP3tunes Client for Android from the Android Market.Just open the Market application on your device and search for the term "mp3tunes". Installing the version from the Market will ensure that you get the latest updates as they are released.

If you are a developer, advanced user, or are unable to install software from the Market you can always [download](http://mp3tunes.googlecode.com/files/mp3tunes-android.apk) and install the .apk file directly. You have to modify the system settings on your Android device to be be able to install Non-Market .apk files directly.

## Creating MP3tunes Account ##

Before you can upload files you have to create a free MP3tunes Locker account. You can sign up by going to http://www.mp3tunes.com/signup

In the lower left you will see an option for a free 2 GB account. Select that option and then type your email and password on the right. You have to read and agree to to the terms and conditions. Then, click the button to create your account.

You should receive a welcome email to the address that you signed up with. If you need more storage space you can upgrade your MP3tunes service to a Premium account whenver you want. We recommend that people try out the free account before considering an upgrade.

## Uploading Music ##

Before you can listen to music on your Android device you have to upload it to your MP3tunes locker. The locker is sometimes called "cloud storage" or "the cloud". The way that it works is that you have to use a free PC program called [LockerSync](http://www.mp3tunes.com/download) to upload your files. After you install [LockerSync](http://www.mp3tunes.com/download) on your Mac or Windows PC you can upload your files. MP3tunes supports these formats: .mp3, .mp4, .m4a, .aac, .wma, .ogg, and .flv. MP3tunes does not support lossless formats or files that are encrypted with digital rights management (DRM). After you upload your files you can go to http://www.mp3tunes.com/player to view the contents of your Locker on a Mac or Windows PC.

## Logging In ##

After you have the MP3tunes Android client installed on your device you simple click on the icon to launch the app. You will see a log in screen. Type in your MP3tunes email address and password.
